Average heat exchange rate in one direction of symmetric graded sample is 3.72663 eV/ps.
x length is  611.30 A, y length (width) is  152.49 A, and thickness taken as  3.40 A
Average Tmin between 1000 ps to 2100 ps =  230.25 K
Temp difference =  147.16 K over  30.56 nm
Mean Std. of slab T's from 1000 to 2100 ps=7.507852590158672 K
which is  5.10 % of the temperature difference
Heat flux =  0.011516 e+13 W/m2
k =  23.9195 W/m.K		G =  0.7826 e9 W/m2.K
considering 1000 ps to 2100 ps averaged temperature profile atleast 6 nm away from source and sink,
k from forward region slope =  31.0700 W/m.K
k from reverse region slope =  32.0388 W/m.K
average k from slope =   31.5544 W/m.K

Rate of change of system total energy is  0.00018125 +/-  0.00000198 eV/ps
